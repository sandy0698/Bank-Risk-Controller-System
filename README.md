In the financial industry, assessing the risk of customer default is crucial for maintaining a healthy credit portfolio. Default occurs when a borrower fails to meet the legal obligations of a loan. Accurate prediction of default can help financial institutions mitigate risks, allocate resources efficiently, and develop strategies to manage potentially delinquent accounts. This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of customer default using historical data.

Overview
The objective is to predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on various features related to their credit history, personal information, and financial status. The target variable for this prediction is “TARGET”, where a value of 1 indicates default and 0 indicates no default.

Problem Statement
This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of customer default using historical data,whether a customer will default on a loan based on various features related to their credit history, personal information, and financial status.

Data Description
The dataset provided contains multiple features that may influence the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan. These features include:

Personal Information: Age, gender, etc. Credit History: Previous loan defaults, credit score, number of open credit lines, etc. Financial Status: Annual income, current debt, loan amount, etc. Employment Details: Employment status, etc. The target variable, TARGET, is binary: 0: No default 1: Default

Work Flow
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and transform categorical variables into a suitable format for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution of data, identify important features, and detect any patterns or correlations that might help in prediction.
Model Development: Train various classification models to predict the target variable, including but not limited to Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score. Select the best-performing model for deployment.
Sentiment Analysis: Performing sentiment analysis on randome based text using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) Transfor learning to uncover insights and improvement natural language processing techniques.
Conclusion
The expected outcome of this project is a robust predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to default on their loans. This will enable the financial institution to proactively manage their credit portfolio, implement targeted interventions, and ultimately reduce the risk of loan defaults.
